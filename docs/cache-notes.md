# Cache Strategy\n\n- Company dashboard data is cached for ~3 minutes per user/scope key. Any change-request status transition (submit, approve, reject, needs info) bumps the dashboard cache version via \CompanyDashboardAssembler::invalidateCache()\.\n- Beneficiary change-request listings are cached for 60 seconds per beneficiary (eneficiary:change-requests:list:{id}). Draft saves, submissions, and status decisions clear the cache to keep the list fresh.\n\nWhen adding new dashboards or change-request flows, either reuse these helpers or call \clearListCache\/\invalidateCache\ so data stays consistent.
